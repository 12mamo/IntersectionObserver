Abstract: This specification describes  an API that can be used to understand the visibility and position of DOM elements relative to a viewport. The position is delivered asynchronously and is useful for understanding the visibility of elements and implementing pre-loading and deferred loading of DOM content.

<h2 id='introduction'>Introduction</h2>
    The web's traditional position calculation mechanisms rely on explicit
    queries of DOM state that are known to cause (expensive) style recalcuation
    and layout and, frequently, are a source of significant performance
    overhead due to continuous polling for this information.

    A body of common practice has evolved that relies on these behaviors,
    however, including (but not limited to):
    <ul>
      <li>Building custom pre- and deferred-loading of DOM and data.</li>
      <li>Implementing data-bound high-performance scrolling lists which load
          and render subsets of data sets. These lists are a central mobile
          interaction idiom.</li>
      <li>Calculating element visibility. In particular,
          <a href="http://www.iab.net/iablog/2014/03/viewability-has-arrived-what-you-need-to-know-to-see-through-this-sea-change.html">
          ad networks now require reporting of ad "visibility" for monetizing
          impressions</a>. This has led to many sites abusing scroll handlers
          (causing jank on scroll),
          <a href="http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html">
          synchronous layout invoking readbacks</a> (causing unneccessary
          critical work in rAF loops), and resorting to exotic plugin-based
          solutions for computing "true" element visibility (with all the
          associated overhead of the plugin architecture).</li>
    </ul>

    These use-cases have several common properties:
    <ol>
      <li>They can be represented as passive "queries" about the state of individual elements with respect to some other element (or the global viewport)</li>
      <li>They do not impose hard latency requirements; that is to say, the information can be delivered asynchronously (e.g. from another thread) without penalty</li>
      <li>They are poorly supported by nearly all combinations of existing web platform features, requiring extraordinary developer effort despite their widespread use.</li>
    </ol>

    A notable non-goal is pixel-accurate information about what was actually
    displayed (which can be quite difficult to obtain efficiently in certain
    browser architectures in the face of filters, webgl, and other features).
    In all of these scenarios the information is useful even when delivered at
    a slight delay and without perfect compositing-result data.

    The Intersersection Observer API addresses the above issues by giving
    developers a new method to asynchronously query the position of an element
    with respect to other elements or the global viewport. The asynchronous
    delivery eliminates the need for costly DOM and style queries, continuous
    polling, and use of custom plugins. By removing the need for these methods
    it allows applications to significantly reduce their CPU, GPU and energy
    costs.

    <pre class="example">
      <code highlight="js">
        var observer = new IntersectionObserver(function(changes) {
          for (var i in changes) {
            console.log(changes[i].time);               // Timestamp when the change occurred
            console.log(changes[i].rootBounds);         // Unclipped area of _root_
            console.log(changes[i].intersectionRect);   // Unclipped area of _target_ intersected with _rootBounds_
            console.log(changes[i].boundingClientRect); // _target.boundingClientRect()_
            console.log(changes[i].target);             // the Element _target_
          }
        }, {});

        // Watch all threshold events on a specific descendant of the viewport
        observer.observe(childElement);

        observer.disconnect(); // removes all

<h2 id='2-intersection-observer'>Intersection Observer</h2>
    The <dfn>Intersection Observer</dfn> API enables developers to understand
    the visibility and position of DOM elements relative to a root element or
    the top level document's viewport.

<h3 id='2-1-intersection-observer-callback'>The IntersectionObserverCallback</h3>
<pre class="idl">
  callback IntersectionObserverCallback = void (IntersectionObserverEntryList entries, IntersectionObserver observer)
</pre>
This callback will be invoked when there are changes to <i>target</i>'s intersection with <i>root</i>, as per the <a>processing model</a>.

<h3 id='2-2-intersection-observer-interface'>The IntersectionObserver interface</h3>
    The {{IntersectionObserver}} interface can be used to observe changes in the intersection of a <i>target</i> {{Element}} and a <i>root</i> {{Element}} (or the top-level document's viewport).

    A <dfn>registered intersection observer</dfn> consists of an observer (an {{IntersectionObserver}} object) and options (an {{IntersectionObserverInit}} dictionary).

    <pre class="idl">
      [Constructor(IntersectionObserverCallback callback, IntersectionObserverInit options), Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
      interface IntersectionObserver {
        void observe (Element target);
        void unobserve (Element target);
        void disconnect ();
        IntersectionObserverEntryList takeRecords ();
      };
    </pre>

<h3 id="2-3-intersection-observer-entry-list">
  The IntersectionObserverEntryList typedef

    <pre class="idl">
      typedef sequence&lt;IntersectionObserverEntry&gt; IntersectionObserverEntryList;

<h3 id="2-4-intersection-observer-entry">The IntersectionObserverEntry interface</h3>
    <pre class="idl">
      interface IntersectionObserverEntry {
        readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp time;
        readonly attribute DOMRect rootBounds;
        readonly attribute DOMRect boundingClientRect;
        readonly attribute DOMRect intersectionRect;

            The {{DOMRect}} corresponding to the <i>target</i>'s
            {{getBoundingClientRect}}.
        : <dfn>intersectionRect</dfn>
        ::
            The {{DOMRect}} corresponding to <i>boundingClientRect</i>
            intersected by each of <i>target</i>'s ancestors' clip rects
            (up to but not including {{root}}), intersected with
            {{rootBounds}}. This value represents the portion of <i>target</i>
            actually visible within {{rootBounds}}.
        : <dfn>rootBounds</dfn>
        ::
            The visible dimensions of {{root}}, adjusted by {{rootMargin}},
            in the coordinate space of the document the root element is in. If
            {{root}} is undefined, then use the coordinate space of the
            top-level document.
        : <dfn>target</dfn>
        ::
            The {{element}} whose intersection with {{root}} changed.
        : <dfn>time</dfn>
        ::
            The attribute must return a {{DOMHighResTimeStamp}} that
            corresponds to the time the intersection was recorded.

<h3 id="2-5-intersection-observer-init">The IntersectionObserverInit dictionary</h3>
    <pre class="idl">

            top-level document's viewport.
        : <dfn>rootMargin</dfn>
        ::
            Same as {{margin}}, can be 1, 2, 3 or 4 components, possibly
            negative lengths.

            If there is only one component value, it applies to all sides.
            If there are two values, the top and bottom margins are set to
            the first value and the right and left margins are set to the
            second. If there are three values, the top is set to the first
            value, the left and right are set to the second, and the bottom
            is set to the third. If there are four values, they apply to the
            top, right, bottom, and left, respectively.e.g.
            <pre class="example">
              <code class="js">
                "5px"                // all margins set to 5px

            </pre>
        : <dfn>threshold</dfn>
        ::
            Threshold at which to trigger callback. callback will be invoked
            when intersectionRect's area changes from greater than or equal
            to threshold to less than threshold, and vice versa.

            This is a {{length}} value.
