# Position Observers Explained

## What's All This About?

This repo outlines an API that can be used to understand the visibility and position of DOM elements relative to a viewport. The position is delivered asynchronously and is useful for understanding the visibility of elements, managing pre-loading of DOM and data, as well as deferred loading of "below the fold" page content.
